Flow: Arrival, Stockings, Gifts, Dinner, Post, Leaving.


(stockings)

Person A pulls Small Gift A out of their stocking. Reaction A. (iterate through these)

Child A already emptied their stocking before everyone else got started, so they have to sit there and watch everyone else like a FOOL.

Person A wears their stocking like a real sock. No one laughs. Tough crowd, AMIRITE?!

Person A mistook Person B's stocking as their own. We've had the same stockings for, like, twenty years... How do you not know your own?!

Person A is jealous of Person B's gift... But they're an adult so they can just buy one for themself. :^)


(gifts)

Person A and Person B exchange gifts.
Person A unwraps Gift A. Person B unwraps Gift B.
Silent disappointment falls across both of their faces.
After a short discussion, it's discovered that Person A sold their Item A to buy Person B's gift.
And Person B sold their Item B to buy Person A's gift!
Y'all should probably talk more.

Person A has arranged a scavenger hunt for Child A!! Oh Boy!
Apparently, they've hidden a bunch of video games all across the house! Yippie!
Child A jumps up and starts tearing the whole house apart to find their beloved gifts! Wahoo!
Child A finds Video Game A for Console. Okay...
Child A finds Video Game B for Console. Hm.
Child A finds Video Game C for Console. Yikes.
Child A hopes Game Stop will give them more than ten cents for these...

Person A upwraps Gift A from Person B. Reaction A. (iterate through these for all guests)

Every time Child A opens a gift, they fart and blame it on a different family member. No one is fooled.

Child A is throwing a fit because they didn't get a super obscure meme-based gift they wanted.
Everyone is annoyed and their parents are extremely embarrassed.

Pet A gets trapped in the pile of wrapping paper.

Person A hands out their gifts to everyone. Unsurprisingly, none of them are wrapped, but they're still pretty good gifts.


(dinner)

Person A for some reason doesn't understand how, like, buffet lines work? They keep going to random food instead of following the flow of everyone else. How rude.

Child A is complaining that there's no food that they like. Their parent pulls out a special meal made just for them. Person B is annoyed. Why can't you just teach your kid to try new things?!

Person A brought a dish to share with everyone! ...It looks sus though and no one tries it due to fear of food poisoning.

Person A brought their ICONIC Dish A. The dish isn't very big and everyone is nervous about not getting any... Person B has no shame and goes straight for it though Who can blame them?

Person A is eating with their mouth open. Person B is using all of their will not to scream at them to stop.

Person A gets... a hard? piece? in their food?! They don't want anyone to be embarrassed so they covertly spit it out while wiping their face.

Person A sneezes without covering their mouth... Right next to all the food... Eugh... Person B tells them to not to be so nasty. Person A shrugs it off!

Person A asks Person B how their food is. Right when they took a bite. Of course. Everyone waits patiently while Person B chews. It feels like an eternity passes. After, like, a century, Person B mumbles "...it good..."

Person A piles their plate RIDICULOUSLY high. On the way to the table, they trip over one of Child A's toys and the food goes everywhere. Pet A is happy to help clean up, hehe.

Person A keeps sneaking table food to Pet A. Pet A is sure to throw up after everyone leaves tonight. Thank you, Person A, very cool.


(post)

Person A, Person B, and Person C start discussing their favorite Christmas movies.
Person A says they love Holiday Movie A. Person B agrees, but brings up Holiday Movie B.
Person C goes into way too much detail about Horror Movie A.
"That's not a holiday movie..." says Person A.
"Okay, what about Horror Movie B?" asks Person C.
"That's not either!!"
"Horror Movie C?"
Person A and Person B sigh and decide to go grab some snacks.

Person A falls asleep on the couch.

Person A is thinking about getting more food...

Person A suggests playing a board game! No one hears them.

Person A starts rambling on about politics. Person B tells them to shut up.
Person A grumpily obliges. Thank god.

Child A breaks one of their gifts. They're obviously upset but hide it so they don't get in trouble.

All the kids are looking at their phones. The adults are upset about "THEM DAMN CELL PHONES" but don't say anything because at least they're quiet.

Pet A vomits in everyone's shoes.


(any category)

Person A goes outside to get some air. Everyone wonders what's wrong with them.

Person A complains about the excessive heat and takes off their sweater. Thankfully they're wearing a shirt underneath.

While no one is looking, Pet A gets into some of the food. Good for them, I guess.

Person A changes into an entirely different outfit. Why...?

Child A pets Pet A. Everyone nervously watches to make sure no one gets hurt...

Child A and Child B start yelling about a popular meme. No one understands what the hell they're on about.
Well, Person A does, but they'd never admit it.

Person A pours themself another glass of wine.
