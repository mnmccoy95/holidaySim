# holidaySim

Due to COVID's stranglehold on the US, many families can't meet up for the holidays (or, like, at all ever)... So why not simulate it?!

Initially I wanted to create a text based Christmas simulator to (hopefully) get a laugh out of my own family, but I'm not the best writer and knew my family wouldn't care, so I abandoned my Christmas deadline. :^)

Maybe some day I will come back to this and let users simulate several different types of events.
